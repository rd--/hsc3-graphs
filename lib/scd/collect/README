The jmcc-examples files here are from the original SC2 distribution
and have been only minimally edited in order to work with the Polyglot
graph browser code segmenter.

The versions of these examples in the "graphs" directory have been
edited to have structures closer to the haskell variants in
"hsc3/Help/Graphs".
